## Global Temperature : Anomalies leaading to global warming</ol>
The Charts here show trends in Temperature changes in the Global, Northern & Southern Hemisphere. Derivation are against the baseline period  1951-1980.
Globally, 2020 was the hottest year on record, effectively tying 2016, the previous record. Overall, Earthâ€™s average temperature has risen more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1880s. Temperatures are increasing due to human activities, specifically emissions of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane.

 ##  HIV-AIDS & Gender Inequality among Adolescents</ol>

  A multitude of inequities drives the HIV epidemic, but gender inequality is a major contributor to the continued spread of HIV globally: 
  Despite significant global progress in the work to reduce HIV infections and HIV/AIDS related deaths, women and girls continue to be disproportionately vulnerable to, and affected by HIV.

  <b>About the Data </b><br>
  Data Courtesy : Inside Airbnb <br>
  By analyzing publicly available information about a city's Airbnb's listings, Inside Airbnb provides filters and key metrics so you can see how Airbnb is being used to compete with the residential housing market.

  This dataset contains 8,111 listings in San Francisco of 4,303 hosts from 2009-2019.
 
## <u>Coal mines of India</u>
Coal use needs to rapidly decline in the global energy mix in the next few decades in order to meet the Paris climate goals of keeping global warming well below 2-degrees Celsius. In emerging economies such as India (the second largest producer and consumer of coal) this would entail reducing long-term coal dependency. 
This analysis shows depth about how coal mining is done in India.
